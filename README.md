# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Summary
Improbable Beef is looking for a bacteria that can synthesize the perfect beef flavor. Roza hypothosizes 
that the bacteria they are looking for will be found in a human belly button. To test her hypothesis
Roza sampled the belly buttons of people across the country. Now we have put together a dashboard so the 
people who provided samples can look and see what bacteria was found within their navel.
